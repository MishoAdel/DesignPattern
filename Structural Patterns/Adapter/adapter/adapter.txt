Adapter Design Pattern

- Works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces

- Used when 1- you want to use an existing class and its interface does not match the one you need
            2- you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforseen classes
            3- when you use need to use several subclasses and it is impractical to adapt their interface by sub-classing every one
