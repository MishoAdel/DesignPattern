Template Method Design Pattern

- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses

- Used when 1- you want to support multiple algorithms that behave conceptually the same but have different implementation for each of their steps
            2- you want to avoid code duplication in an algorithm
